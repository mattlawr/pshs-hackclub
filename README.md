### What does *Hack* Club mean?

When we say *hack*, we're talking about *life hacking*, but with computers.
Hacking is *creative problem solving* of all kinds, and it often includes code.

As a club, we join together with the goal of solving problems using coding skills.
We don't crack into bank accounts here.

### What do we do?

As part of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) initiative, we regularly meet to engage in computer and coding activities.
Anyone, especially beginners, can join and start programming with us and our guidance.

Throughout the year, we will produce our own **websites**, **games**, and **programs** using professional tools and techniques.
We also have the goal of attending nearby high school **hackathons**, or codefests.

### When do we **meet**?

We will meet in **room 501 every Friday, afterschool**, unless otherwise announced in our [**Remind**](https://pshs.hackclub.com/connect).

Sessions usually run from 3:00-4:30PM. Snacks are not uncommon!
