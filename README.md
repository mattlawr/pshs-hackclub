## Welcome

PSHS Hack Club is a [**student-run**](https://pshs.hackclub.com/about) high school club working to show beginners that they possess the means to create with code.

On this site you will find our communication resources and tools. 

Tools:

- [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Meetings

We will meet in **room 501 every Friday, afterschool**, unless otherwise announced in our **Remind**, found below.

Sessions usually run from 3:00-4:30PM to allow for steady progress. Snacks are not uncommon!

### Remind

Sign up for our remind by texting ***@pshshack* to 81010**, or by using that **@** code in the Remind app.
This is the best way to keep up with meetings!

### Slack

Join the general **Hack Club *Slack*** by entering your email [here](https://hackclub.com/slack_invite/) and following instructions.
This is where you can talk to other Hack Club members from around the world!

Don't forget to join into our club's channel, **#pshs-chat**, once you're in. Feel free to discuss your coding ideas with other members or ask for help on this chat program.

Slack has a mobile app as well as a [desktop client](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) for your personal use!
