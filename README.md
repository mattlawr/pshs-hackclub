## Welcome

This page is a work in progress! Here you will find our communication resources.

### Meetings

Meetings are held afterschool every Friday, unless otherwise announced in our **Remind** found below!

### Hack Club Remind

Sign up for our remind by texting ***@pshshack* to 81010**, or by using that **@** code in the Remind app.
This is the best way to keep up with meetings!
