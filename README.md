### Meetings

We will meet in **room 501 every Friday, afterschool**, unless otherwise announced in our **Remind** found below!

Sessions usually run from 3:00-4:30PM to allow for steady progress.

### Hack Club Remind

Sign up for our remind by texting ***@pshshack* to 81010**, or by using that **@** code in the Remind app.
This is the best way to keep up with meetings!

### Slack

Join the general **Hack Club *Slack*** by entering your email on [this page](https://hackclub.com/slack_invite/) and following instructions.
This is where you can talk to other Hack Club members from around the world!

Don't forget to join into our club's channel, **#pshs-chat**, once you're in.

Slack has a mobile app as well as a [desktop client](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) for your personal use!
